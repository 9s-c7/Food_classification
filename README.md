# Food-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
This project builds a Deep Learning Model using Pre-Trained InceptionResnetV2 to detect the type and quality of food.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a Deep Learning Model using Pre-Trained InceptionResnetV2 to detect the type and quality of food based on certain features. The dataset used is the Food-11 image Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

This dataset contains 16643 food images grouped in 11 major food categories.

## Project Structure

- `food_classification_transfer_learning (1).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
  
You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/9s-c7/Food_classification
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd food_classification_transfer_learning
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook food_classification_transfer_learning (1).ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.
